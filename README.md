# Notes App

## Description
The Notes App is a web application designed to facilitate note-taking with features to add, edit, and delete notes. It utilizes React, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap, and Flowbite to create a user-friendly experience. The app allows users to input a title and description for each note, which are then saved to the browser's local storage. Additionally, it integrates the React Markdown library to format plain text without the need for a text editor or HTML tags.

## Features
- **Add Notes**: Easily create new notes with titles and descriptions.
- **Edit Notes**: Modify the titles or descriptions of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove unwanted notes from the app.
- **Last Modified Timestamp**: The app automatically updates the last modified date and time whenever a note's title or description is edited.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Utilizes React Markdown to render formatted text output.
